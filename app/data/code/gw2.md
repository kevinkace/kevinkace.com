### [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com)

Main informational and marketing site for the greatest MMORPG: *Guild Wars 2*. Probably the largest and most visible site I worked on at ArenaNet. A mish-mash of tech due in part to it's rushed and confused inception. It's built upon a heavily customized internal WordPress instance, from which static HTML pages (and frontend assets) are exported to be served up by JsSrv. Exactly. Frontend is based on YUI 3, using their module loading for page-by-page JS requirements.
