This portfolio site. Express for routing & template rendering. Using Jade for the first time, and there's something nice (terse!) and annoying (DSL) about whitespace dependent code. Using Gulp to build and run app. I'm generating a custom responsive grid to Less from defined breakpoints using Rework Pure Grids.
