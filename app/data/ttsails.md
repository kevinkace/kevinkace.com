A SailsJs app for tracking skateboarding tricks and spots to skate. This started mostly as a reason to give SailsJs a try, which has a few things going for it I really liked:
- clear and simple base for API creation
- comes with Gulp support
- ORM with support to write to disc, bypassing the need for DB creation
- Postgres, which I'll migrate to once dev is more stable
I've incorporated Browserify and Mitrhil (MVC) for the frontend application, Mithril view templates are universal (shared between front and back end). A lot to do here still.
