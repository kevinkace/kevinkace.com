A website for anime & manga cataloging, recommendations, reviews, etc. This is actually [my wife's](http://twitter.com/animeplanet) site, which I've ended up working on in various capacities, including feature design, UX, UI design, and some (mostly frontend) coding. Backend is a LAPP stack (Postgres over MySql), frontend uses Less, jQuery and dullard for some small build tasks.
